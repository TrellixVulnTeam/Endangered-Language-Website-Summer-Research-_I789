The Bhutia Documentation (Pronounced "Boot-ah")

Hello and welcome to my project that I'm working on for Amy Holmes-Tagchungdarpa. The bulk of this project will have been written during my time in the URC. I am writing an online dictionary for Bhutia, an endangered language spoken by the Bhutia in Sikkim and northeast Nepal.
