The Bhutia Documentation (Pronounced "Boot-ah")

Hello and welcome to my project that I'm working on for Amy Holmes-Tagchungdarpa. The bulk of this project will have been written during my time in the URC. I am writing an online dictionary for Bhutia, an endangered language spoken by the Bhutia in Sikkim and northeast Nepal.


Search Bar:
-So getting the search to look good will be tricky. There are three languages: Bhutia, English and Tibetan
-In order to cover all our bases we will need 6 translation bars under the options section
-futhermore we will need to add language options underneath everything
